# ENGEP examples: Repository for examples about how to use ENGEP

## Introduction

This repository contains examples on the usage of [ENGEP](https://github.com/st-yang97/ENGEP) 

## Contents

### Prediction of gene expression in unmeasured genes

This [example](https://github.com/st-yang97/ENGEP-examples/blob/master/Example%20of%20unmeasured%20gene%20expression%20prediction.md)  is a short guide on how to work with ENGEP.

### Identification of novel spatial archetypes

This [example](https://github.com/st-yang97/ENGEP-examples/blob/master/Example%20of%20identification%20of%20novel%20spatial%20archetypes.md) is a detailed guide on how to use ENGEP to identify novel spatial archetypes.


## Datasets

All datasets used are publicly available data, for convenience datasets can be downloaded from Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7825993)

For the references of MERFISH are very large, they can be download by using [BDBag](https://github.com/nemoarchive/host-data-on-nemo/wiki/Download-data-using-a-BDBag)
